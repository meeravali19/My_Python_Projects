# 📂 Project List & Descriptions

## 1. ⏰ Alarm Clock using Python
Tech Used: Python, Tkinter.     
Purpose: GUI-based alarm clock that lets users set alarms for specific times.  
How to Run:
```sh
cd Alarm_clock-using_python-main
python alarm_clock.py
```

## 2. 🧠 Face Detection
Tech Used: Python, OpenCV  
Purpose: Detects faces in real-time using a webcam.  
Features: Uses Haar cascades for efficient detection.  
How to Run:
```sh
cd face_detection
python facedetection.py
```

## 3. 🎮 Fermi Pico Bagel (Number Guessing Game)
Tech Used: Python  
Purpose: A terminal-based logic game where the player guesses a 3-digit number.   
Gameplay: Gives clues like "Fermi" (correct digit and position), "Pico" (correct digit, wrong position), or "Bagel" (wrong digit).  
How to Run:
```sh
cd fermi_pico_bagel_game
python fermi_pico_bagel_game.py
```

## 4. 📄 PDF Reader
## 5. 📷 QR Code Generator & Reader
## 6. 🌈 RGB to Grayscale Converter
Tech Used: Python, OpenCV
Purpose: Converts an RGB image into grayscale format.
How to Run:
```sh
cd rgb_to_grayscale
python convert.py
```
Input: Modify the image path inside the script or use CLI args.
## 7. 🔗 URL Shortener
Tech Used: Python, pyshorteners
Purpose: Takes a long URL and shortens it using a public API (e.g., TinyURL).
How to Run:
```sh
cd url_shortener
python shortener.py
```
Dependencies: **pyshorteners**
## 8. ❤️ FLAMES Game (HTML/JS)
Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Purpose: A fun game that calculates "relationship compatibility" based on names.   
How to Use: Open flames.html in any modern browser.
